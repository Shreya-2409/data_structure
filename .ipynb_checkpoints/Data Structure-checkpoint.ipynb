    "# String slicing is a powerful feature in Python that allows you to extract a portion (or slice) of a string based on specified indices. The basic syntax for slicing is:\n",
    "\n",
    "string[start:stop:step]\n",
    "start: The starting index of the slice (inclusive). If omitted, the default is 0.\n",
    "stop: The ending index of the slice (exclusive). If omitted, the default is the length of the string.\n",
    "step: The step or stride between each index. If omitted, the default is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "Basic Slicing:\n",
    "Extracting a substring from a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "print(text[0:5])  # Output: Hello\n",
    "Here, text[0:5] extracts the substring from index 0 to 4 (the character at index 5 is not included).\n",
    "\n",
    "Omitting start and stop:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you omit start, slicing starts from the beginning of the string.\n",
    "If you omit stop, slicing goes until the end of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(text[:5])   # Output: Hello\n",
    "print(text[7:])   # Output: World!\n",
    "Negative Indices:\n",
    "Negative indices can be used to count from the end of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "print(text[-6:])  # Output: World!\n",
    "print(text[:-7])  # Output: Hello,\n",
    "In the first case, -6 means \"start at the 6th character from the end of the string.\" In the second case, :-7 slices from the beginning up to, but not including, the 7th character from the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using step:\n",
    "The step parameter allows you to skip characters in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(text[::2])  # Output: Hlo ol!\n",
    "print(text[1::2]) # Output: el,Wrd\n",
    "In the first example, text[::2] takes every second character from the string, starting from index 0. In the second example, text[1::2] starts at index 1 and then takes every second character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reversing a String:\n",
    "You can reverse a string by using a negative step.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(text[::-1])  # Output: !dlroW ,olleH\n",
    "Here, [::-1] slices the entire string, but with a step of -1, which effectively reverses it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced Example:\n",
    "Extracting a substring and reversing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(text[7:12][::-1])  # Output: dlroW\n",

    "# Explain the key features of lists in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lists are one of the most versatile and widely used data structures in Python. They are used to store collections of items, and they offer a wide range of features that make them powerful and flexible. Here are the key features of lists in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ordered Collection\n",
    "Order Matters: Lists maintain the order of elements, meaning the order in which you add elements to a list is the order in which they will be stored and accessed.\n",
    "Indexing: Elements in a list can be accessed by their index, starting from 0 for the first element, 1 for the second, and so on. Negative indexing is also supported, with -1 referring to the last element, -2 to the second last, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple\n",
    "print(fruits[-1]) # Output: cherry\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mutable\n",
    "Modifiable: Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content after creation. You can modify individual elements, append new elements, remove elements, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "fruits[1] = \"blueberry\"\n",
    "print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry']\n",
    "\n",
    "fruits.append(\"orange\")\n",
    "print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'orange']\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Heterogeneous Elements\n",
    "Mixed Data Types: Lists can store elements of different data types (e.g., integers, strings, objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "mixed_list = [1, \"apple\", 3.14, True]\n",
    "print(mixed_list)  # Output: [1, 'apple', 3.14, True]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dynamic Size\n",
    "Resizable: Lists can grow or shrink as needed, without requiring the user to define their size ahead of time. This dynamic nature makes them highly flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "numbers.append(4)\n",
    "print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers.pop()\n",
    "print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Slicing\n",
    "Sublist Extraction: You can extract portions of a list using slicing, similar to string slicing. This allows you to work with subsets of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(fruits[1:3])  # Output: ['blueberry', 'cherry']\n",
    "print(fruits[:2])   # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry']\n",
    "\n",
    "6. List Comprehensions\n",
    "Compact Syntax: Python supports list comprehensions, a concise way to create lists based on existing lists or other sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]\n",
    "print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Built-in Functions\n",
    "Useful Functions: Python provides many built-in functions that work with lists, such as len(), min(), max(), sum(), and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "print(len(numbers))  # Output: 4\n",
    "print(max(numbers))  # Output: 40\n",
    "print(sum(numbers))  # Output: 100\n",
    "\n",
    "8. List Methods\n",
    "Versatile Methods: Lists come with a variety of methods that allow you to manipulate them effectively. Some common methods include:\n",
    "    \n",
    "append(): Add an element to the end of the list.\n",
    "extend(): Extend the list by appending elements from another iterable.\n",
    "insert(): Insert an element at a specific position.\n",
    "remove(): Remove the first occurrence of a specified value.\n",
    "pop(): Remove and return an element at a given index (defaults to the last element).\n",
    "sort(): Sort the list in ascending (or specified) order.\n",
    "reverse(): Reverse the order of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"cherry\", \"banana\"]\n",
    "fruits.sort()\n",
    "print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Nesting\n",
    "Lists within Lists: Lists can contain other lists as elements, enabling the creation of multi-dimensional arrays (like matrices).\n",
    "\n",
    "matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n",
    "print(matrix[1][2])  # Output: 6\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Iteration\n",
    "Loops: Lists can be easily iterated over using loops, making it easy to process or manipulate each element in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)"

    "print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'blackberry', 'grape', 'kiwi', 'date', 'elderberry', 'fig', 'grapefruit']\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Deleting Elements in a List\n",

    "# Compare and contrast tuples and lists with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuples and lists are both fundamental data structures in Python, used to store collections of items. However, they have different properties and use cases. Below is a comparison and contrast of tuples and lists, along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mutability\n",
    "Lists: Lists are mutable, meaning that the elements in a list can be changed after the list is created. You can modify, add, or remove elements.\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are immutable, meaning that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# List example\n",
    "fruits_list = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "fruits_list[1] = \"blueberry\"  # Modifying the second element\n",
    "print(fruits_list)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuple example\n",
    "fruits_tuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n",
    "# fruits_tuple[1] = \"blueberry\"  # This would raise a TypeError\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Syntax\n",
    "Lists: Lists are created using square brackets [].\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are created using parentheses ().\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "fruits_list = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "fruits_tuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Performance\n",
    "Lists: Lists are generally slower than tuples when it comes to certain operations like iteration, due to their mutable nature.\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are generally faster than lists because they are immutable, and thus require less memory and processing overhead.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "import timeit\n",
    "\n",
    "list_time = timeit.timeit(stmt=\"[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\", number=1000000)\n",
    "tuple_time = timeit.timeit(stmt=\"(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\", number=1000000)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"List creation time: {list_time}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Tuple creation time: {tuple_time}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use Cases\n",
    "Lists: Use lists when you need a collection of items that can be modified, or when you need to frequently add, remove, or change elements.\n",
    "Tuples: Use tuples when you need a collection of items that should not change, such as fixed data, or when you want to ensure that the data remains constant throughout the program.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "# List for a shopping cart where items can be added or removed\n",
    "shopping_cart = [\"milk\", \"bread\", \"eggs\"]\n",
    "shopping_cart.append(\"butter\")\n",
    "print(shopping_cart)  # Output: ['milk', 'bread', 'eggs', 'butter']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuple for geographic coordinates that should not change\n",
    "coordinates = (40.7128, -74.0060)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Methods\n",
    "Lists: Lists have more built-in methods due to their mutable nature, such as append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop(), clear(), sort(), reverse(), etc.\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples have fewer methods, with count() and index() being the primary ones.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "fruits_list.append(\"date\")\n",
    "print(fruits_list)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "\n",
    "fruits_tuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"banana\")\n",
    "print(fruits_tuple.count(\"banana\"))  # Output: 2\n",
    "print(fruits_tuple.index(\"cherry\"))  # Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Immutability Advantages\n",
    "Lists: The mutable nature of lists is useful when you need to modify a collection of items.\n",
    "Tuples: Immutability in tuples provides a guarantee that the data will remain constant, which can be useful for data integrity, and it also allows tuples to be used as keys in dictionaries (since dictionary keys must be immutable).\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "# Tuple as a key in a dictionary\n",
    "locations = {\n",
    "    (\"New York\", \"USA\"): \"Big Apple\",\n",
    "    (\"Paris\", \"France\"): \"City of Light\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "print(locations[(\"New York\", \"USA\")])  # Output: Big Apple\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Memory Usage\n",
    "Lists: Because lists are mutable, they generally consume more memory than tuples.\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples, being immutable, are more memory-efficient than lists.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "list_example = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "tuple_example = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"List memory size: {sys.getsizeof(list_example)} bytes\")\n",
    "print(f\"Tuple memory size: {sys.getsizeof(tuple_example)} bytes\")"

They are particularly useful when you need to store distinct items and perform common set operations like union, intersection, and difference. Below are the key features of sets along with examples of their use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features of Sets\n",
    "Unordered Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are unordered, meaning the elements do not have a specific order, and there is no guarantee that items will be stored in any particular sequence.\n",

    "print(fruits_set)  # Output: {'apple', 'cherry', 'banana'} (order may vary)\n",
    "Unique Elements\n",

    "Mutable\n",
    "\n",

    "# Discuss the use cases of tuples and sets in Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuples and sets are both essential data structures in Python, each with unique properties that make them suitable for specific use cases. Below are the main use cases for tuples and sets in Python programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases for Tuples\n",
    "Fixed Collections of Related Items\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Tuples are ideal for grouping related pieces of data that should be treated as a single entity and should not change.\n",
    "Example: Storing the coordinates of a point in a 2D space.\n",
    "\n",
    "point = (3, 4)\n",
    "Returning Multiple Values from Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: When a function needs to return more than one value, tuples provide a convenient way to return multiple items as a single collection.\n",
    "Example: Returning both the quotient and remainder of a division operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    quotient = a // b\n",
    "    remainder = a % b\n",
    "    return (quotient, remainder)\n",
    "\n",
    "result = divide(10, 3)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: (3, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable Data Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Tuples are used when the data should remain constant throughout the program. This immutability ensures that the data cannot be accidentally modified.\n",
    "Example: Days of the week, which are constant and should not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "days_of_week = (\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\", \"Sunday\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are immutable, unlike lists.\n",
    "Example: Storing geographic coordinates as keys for a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "locations = {\n",
    "    (40.7128, -74.0060): \"New York\",\n",
    "    (34.0522, -118.2437): \"Los Angeles\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "Storing Heterogeneous Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Tuples can store a collection of items that may be of different types, making them useful for passing around or storing heterogeneous data.\n",
    "Example: A tuple representing a book with its title, author, and year of publication.\n",
    "\n",
    "book = (\"The Great Gatsby\", \"F. Scott Fitzgerald\", 1925)\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Tuples are more memory-efficient than lists. When you need to store a large collection of immutable data, tuples are preferable.\n",
    "Example: Using tuples to store large sets of constant data in a memory-constrained environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "large_constant_data = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Supporting Multiple Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Tuples are often used in Python's multiple assignment feature, allowing the assignment of multiple variables at once.\n",
    "Example: Swapping values between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "a, b = 5, 10\n",
    "a, b = b, a\n",
    "print(a, b)  # Output: 10, 5\n",
    "Use Cases for Sets\n",
    "Eliminating Duplicates\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Sets automatically remove duplicate elements, making them useful for tasks where uniqueness is required.\n",
    "Example: Removing duplicate entries from a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "items = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\n",
    "unique_items = set(items)\n",
    "print(unique_items)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "Membership Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Sets provide efficient operations for testing whether an element is present in the collection.\n",
    "Example: Checking if a user input is within a predefined set of valid responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "valid_responses = {\"yes\", \"no\", \"maybe\"}\n",
    "response = \"yes\"\n",
    "if response in valid_responses:\n",
    "    print(\"Valid response\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid response\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "Mathematical Set Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Sets are designed to support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, which are useful in various applications.\n",
    "Example: Finding common elements (intersection) between two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "group_A = {\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"}\n",
    "group_B = {\"Charlie\", \"David\", \"Edward\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "common_members = group_A & group_B\n",
    "print(common_members)  # Output: {'Charlie'}\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Unordered Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Sets are suitable when the order of elements is not important, and you only care about the presence of distinct elements.\n",
    "Example: Managing tags or categories in a content management system where the order of tags is irrelevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "tags = {\"python\", \"programming\", \"tutorial\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing Elements with Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Sets provide methods like discard() and remove() to conditionally remove elements, making them useful in filtering operations.\n",
    "Example: Removing invalid entries from a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "data = {\"valid1\", \"valid2\", \"invalid1\", \"valid3\"}\n",
    "data.discard(\"invalid1\")\n",
    "print(data)  # Output: {'valid1', 'valid2', 'valid3'}\n",
    "\n",
    "Set Operations in Database Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Sets are often used in applications that involve database queries, where operations like finding common records or exclusive records are needed.\n",
    "Example: Identifying users who are only in one of two different mailing lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "list_A = {\"user1\", \"user2\", \"user3\"}\n",
    "list_B = {\"user3\", \"user4\", \"user5\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "exclusive_users = list_A ^ list_B\n",
    "print(exclusive_users)  # Output: {'user1', 'user2', 'user4', 'user5'}\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient Handling of Large Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Sets are optimized for large collections where you need to frequently add, remove, or check for the existence of elements, making them suitable for real-time data processing.\n",
    "Example: Tracking active users in a live chat application.\n",
    "\n",
    "active_users = {\"user1\", \"user2\", \"user3\"}\n",
    "active_users.add(\"user4\")\n",

    "\n",
    "# In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they are created. This requirement is crucial for ensuring that dictionaries, which are implemented as hash tables, operate correctly and efficiently. Let's discuss why immutability is important for dictionary keys, along with examples to illustrate this concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Dictionary Keys Must Be Immutable\n",
    "Hashing and Uniqueness\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries in Python are implemented as hash tables. When a key-value pair is added to a dictionary, the key is passed through a hashing function to generate a unique hash code. This hash code is used to determine where the key-value pair will be stored in the dictionary.\n",
    "If keys were mutable, their hash code could change if the object itself was modified. This would result in the dictionary losing track of where the key is stored, leading to incorrect or unpredictable behavior when trying to access, modify, or delete items.\n",
    "Consistency and Reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutability ensures that the key's value remains constant throughout its lifecycle, providing consistency in operations. If keys were mutable, any change to the key's value would undermine the dictionary's internal structure, making it unreliable.\n",
    "By ensuring that keys are immutable, Python dictionaries can consistently map keys to values, and operations like lookups, insertions, and deletions can be performed efficiently and correctly.\n",
    "Efficient Lookups\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficiency of dictionary operations relies heavily on the ability to quickly compute a hash value for a key. Immutable objects have fixed hash values, so lookups can be performed in constant time, O(1), on average.\n",
    "If keys were mutable and their hash values changed, the dictionary would have to rehash and potentially reallocate storage, which would be computationally expensive and negate the benefits of using a hash table.\n",
    "Examples of Immutable and Mutable Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Immutable Keys\n",
    "Strings:\n",
    "Strings are immutable, making them ideal for use as dictionary keys. Once a string is created, its value cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",
    "print(my_dict[\"name\"])  # Output: Alice\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples:\n",
    "Tuples, which are ordered collections of elements, are immutable if they contain only immutable elements. This makes tuples valid dictionary keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "coordinates = {(10, 20): \"Point A\", (30, 40): \"Point B\"}\n",
    "print(coordinates[(10, 20)])  # Output: Point A\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers:\n",
    "Integers, floats, and other numeric types are immutable and can be used as dictionary keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = {1: \"one\", 2: \"two\", 3: \"three\"}\n",
    "print(numbers[2])  # Output: two\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mutable Keys (Invalid)\n",
    "Lists:\n",
    "Lists are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed after creation. Because of this, they cannot be used as dictionary keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "# This will raise a TypeError\n",
    "# my_dict = {my_list: \"value\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries:\n",
    "Since dictionaries themselves are mutable, they also cannot be used as keys in other dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dict = {1: \"one\", 2: \"two\"}\n",
    "# This will raise a TypeError\n",
    "# another_dict = {my_dict: \"value\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequences of Using Mutable Keys\n",
    "Attempting to use a mutable object as a dictionary key will result in a TypeError because Python cannot guarantee that the key will remain consistent. Here's an example of what happens if you try:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "try:\n",
